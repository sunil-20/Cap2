The U.S. Small Business Administration(SBA), which came out of the response to the Great Depression and World War II has been helping small business establishments since 1953 in the U.S. SBA is providing assistance to the small business establishment by providing easier access to the capital market via loan guarantees, contracts and counseling. 

As we are in the midst of COVID-19, the main quest that remained in this unprecedented time is how to survive. The pandemic continues to take its toll on the nation's economy and the government's major effort has been concentrated on stymieing the spread of the virus. Another reality is that almost one-third of small businesses were not able to survive during the COVID-19 pandemic. Small businesses have been one of the leading sectors in job creation and sparking innovation. This sector generates about 50 percent of the gross domestic product(GDP).

Considering the fact of the immense importance of SBA loans and the present pandemic, I was curious to see how the loan applicant has been ended up as a default? So, my primary goal in this study was to find the major factors that play an important role in making the loan default. This study will help in decision-making by the financial agencies on which applicants' loans should they approve?
